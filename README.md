# Comparison - CACODE and GHE

Comparison of cause-specific mortality estimates from CA CODE and GHE. See `src` folder for code and `make.R` for how to run analysis. Processed data outputs are located in `gen` folder. 

See `./data/classification-keys/GHE-CACODE-cause-mapping.csv` for mapping of GHE causes to CA CODE causes. Need to check the CA CODE cause mapping for 00-01m and 01to59m. Does not impact the present analysis though, as only making direct comparisons between GHE and CA CODE estimates for 5-19y. Other raw data used in the analysis has not been pushed to github due to size. 

Figures and tables were generated from the code in `Rmd` files. Click links to `md` files below to see tables and figures compiled with notes.
